# Brainwave-Instrument
It is a music system that can translate brain signals into sound and visual elements. The system requires two performers to work together. One of them plays the piano and the other one is monitored for his/her brainwave activity. The music from the piano will influence the performerâ€™s brain. The signals from the brain will be translated into different music notes and shapes. The goal is to allow two performances to communicate with music and brain activities when they are performing.
